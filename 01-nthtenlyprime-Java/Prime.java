// We will say that a number is "tenly" (a made-up term) 
// if the digits of the number add up to 10.
// So 1153 is tenly, but 153 is not. With this in mind, 
// write the function nthTenlyPrime(n) that takes
// a non-negative int n and returns the nth number that 
// is both tenly and prime.
// You should also write all the required helper functions.
// The first several tenly primes are: 19, 37, 73, 109, 127
