// fabricYards(inches)
// Fabric must be purchased in whole yards, so purchasing just 1 inch 
// of fabric requires purchasing 1 entire yard. With this in mind, 
// write the function fabricYards(inches) that takes the number of 
// inches of fabric desired, and returns the smallest number of whole 
// yards of fabric that must be purchased.

// fabricExcess(inches)
// Write the function fabricExcess(inches) that takes the number of 
// inches of fabric desired and returns the number of inches of excess 
// fabric that must be purchased (as purchases must be in whole yards).
// Hint: you may want to use fabricYards, which you just wrote!
