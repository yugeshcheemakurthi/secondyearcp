#  We will say that a number is "tenly" (a made-up term) 
#  if the digits of the number add up to 10.
#  So 1153 is tenly, but 153 is not. With this in mind, 
#  write the function nthTenlyPrime(n) that takes
#  a non-negative int n and returns the nth number that 
#  is both tenly and prime.
#  You should also write all the required helper functions.
#  The first several tenly primes are: 19, 37, 73, 109, 127

def nthTenlyPrime(n):
    # Your code goes here...
    pass


# Write your own test cases based on the above given test cases.
