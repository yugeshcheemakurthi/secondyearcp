# Write the function movieAwards(oscarResults) that takes a set of tuples, where each tuple holds the name of a category and the name of the winning movie, then returns a dictionary mapping each movie to the number of the awards that it won. For example, if we provide the set:
# { 
#     ("Best Picture", "The Shape of Water"), 
#     ("Best Actor", "Darkest Hour"),
#     ("Best Actress", "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"),
#     ("Best Director", "The Shape of Water"),
#     ("Best Supporting Actor", "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"),
#     ("Best Supporting Actress", "I, Tonya"),
#     ("Best Original Score", "The Shape of Water")
# }
# the function should return as follows
# { 
#     "Darkest Hour" : 1,
#     "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri" : 2,
#     "The Shape of Water" : 3,
#     "I, Tonya" : 1
# }
