// IsKingsTour
// Background:  in Chess, a King can move from any square to
 any adjacent square.  A King’s Tour is a series of legal 
 King moves so that every square is visited exactly once. 
  We can represent a Kings Tour in a 2d list where the numbers 
  represent the order the squares are visited, going from 1 to
   N2.  For example, consider these 2d lists:

//    [ [  3, 2, 1 ],    	[ [  1, 2, 3 ],  	[ [ 3, 2, 1 ],
//  	[  6, 4, 9 ],      	[  7, 4, 8 ],    	[ 6, 4, 0 ],
//  	[  5, 7, 8 ] ]     	[  6, 5, 9 ] ]   	[ 5, 7, 8 ] ]

// The first is a legal Kings Tour but the second is not, 
// because there is no way to legally move from the 7 to the 8, 
// and the third is not, because it contains a 0 which is out of
//  range.  With this in mind, write the method 
//  isKingsTour(board) that takes a 2d list of integers, 
//  which you may assume is NxN for some N>0, and returns 
//  True if it represents a legal Kings Tour 
//  and False otherwise.

public class Chess {
    public boolean isKingsTour(int[][] board) {
        // Your code goes here....
        return false;
    }
}
