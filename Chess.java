// IsKnightsTour
// Background:  A "knight's tour in chess is a sequence of 
// legal knight moves such that the knight visits every square 
// exactly once. We can represent a (supposed) knight's tour as an 
// NxN list of the integers from 1 to N2 listing the positions in 
// order that the knight occupied on the tour.  If it is a legal 
// knight's tour, then all the numbers from 1 to N2 will be 
// included and each move from k to (k+1) will be a legal 
// knight's move. With this in mind, write the function 
// isKnightsTour(board) that takes such a 2d list of integers 
// and returns True if it represents a legal knight's tour 
// and False otherwise.

// To help you undertand how a knight's tour is represented, and so you can write your own test cases, here is one example of a successful knight's tour:
// board = [
//                       [  1, 60, 39, 34, 31, 18,  9, 64 ],
//           [ 38, 35, 32, 61, 10, 63, 30, 17 ],
//           [ 59,  2, 37, 40, 33, 28, 19,  8 ],
//           [ 36, 49, 42, 27, 62, 11, 16, 29 ],
//           [ 43, 58,  3, 50, 41, 24,  7, 20 ],
//           [ 48, 51, 46, 55, 26, 21, 12, 15 ],
//           [ 57, 44, 53,  4, 23, 14, 25,  6 ],
//           [ 52, 47, 56, 45, 54,  5, 22, 13 ],
//         ]
// when the function is called with the above board should return true.

public class Chess {
    public boolean isKnightsTour(int[][] board) {
        // Your code goes here...
        return false;
    }
}
