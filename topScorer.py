# topScorer(data) [10 Points]
# Write the function topScorer(data) that takes a multi-line 
# string encoding scores as csv data for some kind of 
# competition with players receiving scores, so each 
# line has comma-separated values. The first value on 
# each line is the name of the player (which you can 
# assume has no integers in it), and each value after 
# that is an individual score (which you can assume is a 
# non-negative integer). You should add all the scores 
# for that player, and then return the player with the 
# highest total score. If there is a tie, return all the 
# tied players in a comma-separated string with the names 
# in the same order they appeared in the original data. 
# If nobody wins (there is no data), return None (not the 
# string "None"). So, for example:

def topScorer(data):
    Fred=[]
    Wilma=[]
    if(data==''):
        return None
    x=data.splitlines()
    for i in x:
        s=i.split(",")
        for j in range(1,len(s)):
            if(s[0]=="Fred"):
                Fred.append(int(s[j]))
            else:
                Wilma.append(int(s[j]))
    if(max(Fred)>max(Wilma)):
        return "Fred"
    elif(max(Fred)==max(Wilma)):
        return "Fred,Wilma"
    else:
        return "Wilma"


        
data = '''\
Fred,10,20,30,40
Wilma,10,20,30
'''
assert(topScorer(data) == 'Fred')

data = '''\

'''
assert(topScorer(data) == 'Fred,Wilma')

assert(topScorer('') == None)
print("All test cases passed...!")
# Hint: you may want to use both splitlines() and split(',') here!
